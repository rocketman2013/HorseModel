# HorseModel

**Description:** This is a simple model trained on a small amount of public available horse racing data, giving a prediction of either the horses finishing time in a specified race or the time in seconds a horse finished behind the winner of a specified race. If you have any comments, suggestions, or if you believe anything is intuitively wrong please leave a comment.

**Disclaimer:** *This is not meant to be a tool utilized for betting purposes, this was a short project created out of boredom during winter break. Even if you are successfully able to predict the winners of a horse race, you will not necessarily make money unless you know how to intelligently utilize your bets.*

**Data:** The factors given to the model consist of track conditions, trainer win percentage, jockey win percentage, horse racing style,... with the independent variable of either finishing time or time-back from the winner. 

**Future Goals/Directions:** It would be most helpful to be able to analyze all horses in a given race at once, and have the model give a prediction of each horses odds so the user can see if the model thinks each horses is under or over-valued compared to the odds created by the other bettors (ex if the horse enters a race with its odds at 1/40 but the model gives the horse an odds ration of 1/10 it might be good to bet that horse to place in the top 3). Any suggestions on approaches to this problem would be appreciated.
